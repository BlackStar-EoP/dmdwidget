Simple DMD Widget written in QT for grabbing Zen Studios' Pinball FX3 DMD memory block.
Kudos to Freezy and NoEx for the memory offsets, acquired from dmdext, project located at https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/.

Plan for this project is to create a binary that will only support PinDMD2 (at least for now) and will only grab memory from Pinball FX3.
Additional support planned for idle animations and at least have an interface so it can be extended to support PinDMD3. (Could also be PinDMD1 but I consider PinDMD1 obsolete)
